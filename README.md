# Testing Assignment

This assigment will introduce you to the pytest framework. We will 
be implementing some tests for the [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)
package, which we used in the last assignment. 

Looking over a basic pydantic tutorial (such as
[this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-pydantic-aa374d5c12d))
may also be helpful.

As before, once you are finished with the assignment submit a PR and ping
the instructors for feedback.

## Task 1: Basic Tests (10 points)

Look at test_task_1.py and fill in the test functions according to their
descriptions.  

## Task 2: Fixtures (10 points)

Look at test_task_2.py and fill in the fixtures according to their descriptions.
You shouldn't modify the tests.

## Task 3: Marks and Configuration (5 points)

Look at test_task_3.py and perform required actions. Create a custom mark called 
"long_running" and register it in the pytest.ini file.
See the [pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/mark.html#registering-marks)
for details. 

Next,  look at answers.md and fill in the requested information about pytest command
line usage.
